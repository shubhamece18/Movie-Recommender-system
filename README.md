# Recommender-System

This project aims at recommending movies to the user similar to those liked by him. This project uses Collaborative Filtering method.

Recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users. Collaborative methods for recommender systems are methods that are based solely on the past interactions recorded between users and items in order to produce new recommendations.
This project contains the Recommender System made only using User- based Collaborative Filtering.

This project also contains the dataset of movies in form of two excel sheet files.

After cloning the repository the changes you would have to make so that the program can work correctly are:
  1) Change the location of files ,i.e ratings.csv and movies.csv, in the code to the location where you store these files.
  2) If you want to test the program for different movies you would have to enter the name of your movie in the variable(ToyStoryRatings) in the code and make sure the name of movie is present in the dataset and exactly matches with the name you enter in the code.
